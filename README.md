# Dockerized Spigot Minecraft server
Dockerized [Spigot Minecraft server](https://www.spigotmc.org/) with minimum amount of plugins.

## Roadmap
- Truly vanilla versions of Spigot (so no plugins in main images)
- Support for branches/forks with plugins
- Documentation

## Plugins
Aim is to have a minimum amount of plugins included in the standard build. Currently always included plugins are:
- Dynmap
- Harbor
- ServerLogin with GUI

Plugins can be configured, documentation will be updated at some point.

## Server configuration
Can be done, documentation is to be done.
