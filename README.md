# Spigot Minecraft server Docker image
This repository contains Dockerfile to build working Docker container with [Spigot Minecraft server](https://www.spigotmc.org/).

This README.md is (and will be) incomplete.

As this Docker image is made to fulfill my own interests, it includes a couple of quality-of-life plugins. Please check plugins folder.

For plugin and server configuration please see start.sh and figure it out by yourself.
